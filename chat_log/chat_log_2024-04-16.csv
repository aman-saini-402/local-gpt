Different graduate programs have different score requirements, so it's important to research the average GRE scores of admitted students in your desired program to get a better idea of where you stand.

In general, a score of 317 is above the average GRE score, which is around 305. However, some competitive programs may require higher scores, while others may place less emphasis on GRE scores and consider other factors such as GPA, letters of recommendation, and work experience.

It's also important to consider the breakdown of your GRE score. Admissions committees often look at both the verbal and quantitative sections, as well as the analytical writing section. If your score is balanced across all sections, it can strengthen your overall application.
